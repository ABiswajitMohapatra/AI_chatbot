Chatbot Project

Overview

This project is an AI-powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses stored in a JSON file, improving accuracy through synonym expansion and enhanced training.

Features

Intent Recognition: Uses an intents JSON file to classify user queries.

Machine Learning Model: Trained with TensorFlow/Keras to provide intelligent responses.

Synonym Expansion: Enhances understanding of diverse inputs.

Custom Training: Allows improvement over time with additional data.

Interactive UI (Optional): Can be integrated with a frontend for better user interaction.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-project.git
cd chatbot-project

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the chatbot:

python chatbot.py

Dataset

The chatbot is trained using an intents JSON file located at:

D:\PROJECT\intents.json

This file contains predefined intents, patterns, and responses.

Model Training

To train the model, execute:

python train.py

This will generate model.h5, which is used for predictions.

Usage

Run chatbot.py to start the chatbot.

Enter queries and receive intelligent responses based on training.

Modify intents.json to improve chatbot capabilities.

Future Improvements

Integrate LSTM for better NLP understanding

Deploy as a web or mobile application

Expand the dataset with more intents
