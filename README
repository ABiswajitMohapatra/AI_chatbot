# 🤖 AI Chatbot Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. It understands and responds to user queries intelligently by leveraging a training dataset of intents and responses. The chatbot continuously improves through synonym expansion and custom training.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Intent Recognition**: Classifies user input based on predefined intents in a JSON file.
- 🧠 **ML Model with TensorFlow/Keras**: Trained model (`model.h5`) provides accurate, real-time responses.
- 🧩 **Synonym Expansion**: Enhances flexibility in understanding user queries.
- 🧪 **Custom Training Pipeline**: Easily update and retrain the model as new intents are added.
- 💬 **Interactive Interface (Optional)**: Can be integrated into a web or desktop UI for enhanced usability.

## 📁 Dataset
The training data is structured in a JSON file:
It includes:
- `intents`: A list of objects containing:
  - `tag`: Intent name
  - `patterns`: Example user inputs
  - `responses`: Predefined responses
